- This audio unit host was based on the sample code "CocoaAUHost" from apple. The .exe name (located in the "Products" folder) has been changed
from CocoaAUHost.app to voxReducer.app, and there seems to be some issues with the executable. Look in the builds folder, and run whatever
.exe is created, and change the name there. In the future you may want to create a new project, and import the source files from this project.
